//Define a function underneath here that is named numberAdder
//numberAdder should take 2 parameters and it should return the sum of those two values
//After you're done, try looking around at the CSS and HTML to 
//see if you understand what's going on :)

function numberAdder( num1, num2 ){
    return num1 + num2 // Adds both value of num1 and num2
}
    console.log(numberAdder( 23, 45 )); // Should return the value 68
